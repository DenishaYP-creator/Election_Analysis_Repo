## Election Audit Summary

The python program code was design to calculate vote quickly and efficently. The program can easily be modified and utilized  for future audits campaigns by simple modifying the file report name in the path variable located at the begging of the script.  The script utilizes CSV as the data source but excel file can also be utilized by simply changing the file extension to xlsx.
